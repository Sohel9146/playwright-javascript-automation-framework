# 🚀 Task-10: Verify Image Presence | Playwright JavaScript Automation

---

# 📖 Project Overview

This task automates the verification of the website logo available on the **Automation Exercise** homepage using **Playwright with JavaScript**.

The objective is to verify that the logo image is displayed successfully after the homepage loads.

Unlike previous tasks, no new reusable methods were added to the framework. Instead, this task demonstrates the effective reuse of the existing **BasePage** methods to synchronize the page and validate UI elements.

The framework follows industry-standard automation practices including:

- Page Object Model (POM)
- Base Page Architecture
- Reusable Methods
- JSON Test Data
- Constants File
- Playwright Assertions
- ES Modules (Import / Export)

# 🛠 Technology Stack

| Technology | Version |
|------------|----------|

# 🏗 Framework Enhancement

## Version

**Version 2.3**

### Framework Improvements

This task focuses on **framework reusability** instead of introducing new methods.

The `verifyLogoDisplayed()` method internally reuses two existing BasePage methods:

- ✅ `waitForVisible(locator)`
- ✅ `verifyVisible(locator)`

This improves test stability by ensuring the logo becomes visible before performing the assertion.

---

# ✔ Assertion Used

```javascript
await expect(locator).toBeVisible();
```

---

# ▶ Test Execution

Run complete suite

```bash
npx playwright test
```

Run Task-10

```bash
